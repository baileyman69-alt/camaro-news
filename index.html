<h1>Local Constable Caught Burning Rubber for Christmas</h1>
<div class="meta">By Staff Writer | December 24</div>

<p>Authorities confirmed late Tuesday night that a local constable was allegedly clocked traveling at <strong>162 mph in a posted 55 mph zone</strong> while piloting a supercharged 1967 Chevrolet Camaro.</p>

<p>Witnesses reported hearing “what sounded like freedom” moments before the vehicle disappeared into the night, leaving nothing but tire smoke and shattered holiday peace.</p>

<p>Officials declined to comment on how a vehicle described as “aggressively American” managed to remain airborne over several county lines.</p>

<p>The investigation remains ongoing, though insiders suggest the only real crime may have been not inviting everyone else.</p>
